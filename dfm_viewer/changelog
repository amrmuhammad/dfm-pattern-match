version 0.13.1(to be implemented):
---------------------------------

I want to make the following changes to the DFM Viewer project:

1-  Changes in Layout Viewer:

- The Layout (GDSII/OASIS) File Viewer window shall be behind the DFM Patterns Database viewer.
- The Layout (GDSII/OASIS) File Viewer window shall be covering the whole screen.


2- Changes in DFM Patterns Database Viewer:

- Currently, DFM Patterns Database Viewer gets all the databases in the PostgreSQL Database system. This
shall be changed in version 0.13.1. We will add an item "Connect to DB" inside the File menu item. When 
the user clicks on the "Connect to DB" action, a dialog box shall pop up. This dialog box will contain
a label "Enter DB name: ", and a textbox with default value "Enter database name here". The dialog box will also have a "connect" button. When the user clicks the button, the application shall attempt to 
connect to the database, and load the patterns stored in the database. It will list the patterns in
the patterns list. If the database provided by the use is not a valid database, a red error label shall
be displayed to the user. Possible error scenarios: the user-provided database name does not exist in 
the DB system; or, it exists, but does not have a valid schema. a DB will have a valid schema, if
it has a patterns_db_version table, that has one item, which is a globally unique identifier. The 
code for the DFM patterns DB viewer will have a list of valid GUIDs, and if the value stored in the 
version matches one of those hard-coded versions (GUIDs) then the DB is considered valid, and the
application will attempt to connect to it.
 





version 0.13:
------------

I want to make the following changes to the DFM Viewer project:

1-  Changes in Layout Viewer:

The Layout (GDSII/OASIS) File Viewer window will be open by default when the application starts (no need to open it from Tools menu)

2- Changes in DFM Patterns Database Viewer:

- Add a widget that will be on the left side of the DFM Patterns Database Viewer window. This widget will contain two widgets vertically. The top one will display a list of the patterns databases from which we are retrieving the patterns. The bottom one will display a list of patterns IDs of the patterns stored in the database that the user selects from the top databases list. The top widget should have a label with the content "Patterns Databases List". The bottom widget should have a label with the content "Patterns List for database: "THe name of the patterns database"" which is the patterns 
database that the user selected from the Top patterns databases list 


- The right side of the patterns database viewer will have a widget with multiple panels. When the user selects a pattern from the bottom left widget (the one containing the patterns list), the geometries of the pattern will be displayed in a geometries panel. The metadata of the patterns will be displayed in another panel.
